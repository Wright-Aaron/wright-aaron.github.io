            <h2>Struggles</h2>
            <p>On this page, I really wanted to be totally honest about some of the big struggles that I had as I took this course. Many of my struggles, probably most of them, came from myself. I hope that anyone who read this would be 
                able to learn from my mistakes. There is really no need for anyone else to go through what I went through.</p>
            <p>I had to take this class twice. The first time I got halfway through the semester and had pretty much nothing done. This was due to the fact that assignments in this class do not have as hard of a due date. At least the due 
                dates are not designed to set the pace for the course. Once I had got that far an not accomplished anything, I got so anxious that I never really got started. Really the problem was my attitude. Essentially, I let fear keep me from getting anything done. The 
                second time taking this class it started out very much the same. I found the motivation to get things done in a couple places. First, my wife. I so badly did not want to disappoint her that I really made the commitment to 
                myself that I would not fail this class again. We are wanting to start a family, and I really felt the need to give her the confidence that I could take care of a family.</p>
            <p>Second, I wanted to be able to prove to myself that I would be able to do anything that I set my mind to. If I gave up again, I knew that would only lead to it being even hard the next time. Failing a class does not do a lot 
                for your confidence and I imagine that failing it twice would be devastating.  One of the things that helped the most in getting started was just to cut out the things that were my coping mechanisms. Like video games and 
                YouTube.</p>
            <p>The struggles didnâ€™t really stop there though. I do not consider myself a developer. I got into tech because I am really into hardware. I used to be a field technician and I wanted to take my career to the next level with 
                college. I have found though that almost all programs in tech involve some level of coding. This has been a real struggle but more in this class than any other. I have taking it as an exercise though. The way I got past this 
                struggle was to treat it like a game. Once it becomes a challenge that you are trying to overcome it can actually be quite fun. I also learned that when you work hard to get a technology down, the end result is that much 
                more satisfying. </p>
            <p>Another struggle that might surprise you was my group. You might be thinking surely your group helped you to succeed in this class? You would be right. At the same time, going to group meetings every week and being around such 
                brilliant students who also seemed to be struggling with some of these concepts was at time discouraging. I thought if these people were struggling, I might not be able to do this at all. The best thing that I could do in this 
                situation was to pray. I found the lord telling me to just get started and things would work out. I felt that I was also guided to not compare myself with others so much. This has been a true blessing in my life already and I 
                am sure it will be for years to come.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, there are a number of stressors that may keep of from achieving our goals. There is however always a way through it. You can lean on others to help you find the motivation and confidence, you can cut out distractions, 
                and you can ask for help. The most important person for you to ask for help is Heavenly Father.</p>
