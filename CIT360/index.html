            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my journal report for CIT360 (object-oriented development. ) This is the accumulation of the many lessons that I have learned on my journey through this course. Here, I hope to be able to share with you a number of things, including:<br>
            </p>

            <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
            <P>I feel there has been some major personal stretching that has happened in this class. Because of that I feel I have accomplished a lot. The first, and biggest thing that I feel I accomplished was to overcome my fear of teaching myself coding 
                topics. I will go into more detail about this on the struggles page of this site. The next thing is that I was able to accomplish a basic understanding of 13 object oriented development topics. I will provide links to the repositories where 
                you can see these topics for yourself. The topics include:
