            <h2>Growth</h2>
            <p>This class has stretched me in so many ways. Because of this, I have a number of ways in which I have grown throughout the semester. These ways include: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increased confidence.</li>
                <p class="bulletex">This is actually not the first time that I have taken this class. The first time I took this class it was a train wreck. I just couldn’t get over my anxiety about doing the work for this class. When I would even 
                    think about doing the work, I felt like I would just get too frustrated trying to get it figured out. Also, what if I couldn’t? Now that I have gone through and learned so many development topics, I have greater 
                    confidence. In fact, I believe that I could learn anything in development that I set my mind to.</p>
                <li>Less dependence on structure.</li>
                <p class="bulletex">This class has helped me to realize that I do not need to have everything laid out for me. This class was so self-directed that I gained the ability to set my own path through my education. I do not need someone 
                    to tell me read this and do this assessment in order to learn. This gives me a great outlook for the future.</p>
                <li>Better problem solving skills.</li>
                <p class="bulletex">As I have tried to not only understand the topics in this class, but also to know how and why to implement them, I have improved greatly in my ability to use resources such as language documentation, forums, search 
                    engines, and experimentation. Having these skill has improved the rate at which I learn new topics.</p>
                <li>Trust in the Lord.</li>
                <p class="bulletex">One thing that I have gained a testimony of as I have worked through this course is that through the Lord’s help, all things are possible. Prayer has made all the difference. I did not do a great job of praying at 
                    the beginning of the semester and it showed in my work. Later I made a point of always praying and it has made all the difference.</p>
            </ul>

            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <P>Learning new technologies can be daunting at times. Let me share a few simple things that I have learned to make the process much less painful and even enjoyable. 
            </P>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Always pray.</b> There are no exceptions here. Just do it!</li>
                <li>There are a few websites that are very useful in helping you to learn java and many other programming languages. Here are a few of my favorites: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">GeeksforGeeks</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/index.htm">tutorialspoint</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.guru99.com/">GURU99</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/">javaTpoint</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/">Official Oracle Java documentation</a></li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Be patient.</b> There is nothing that will make it harder to learn then getting worked up. It takes time to learn this stuff and you shouldn't rush it.</li>
                <li><b>Take breaks</b> when you need them. I have found that it is very easy to get caught up on one problem and keep banging your head against it until you go crazy. I have found that when I get to the point where I am making no progress 
                    it is better to just step away for awhile. When you come back you will see it with fresh eyes. Some of my best programming solutions have come in my morning shower.
                </li>
                <li><b>Visit the forums.</b> These are a great resource. Chances are if you are having a problem, someone else has as well. There is no need to suffer alone. Here are a couple good ones: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.community/">GitHub Community Forum</a></li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Find a mentor.</b> Finding a mentor to help guide you through your journey of learning development is a great way of getting ahead. There is always value in learning from someone who has already walked the walk. The one warning that 
                    I would give here is to not be closed to different approachs. It is very easy to just trust everything that our mentors tell us. The problem is that there are new things out there that they may not have considered. Also, no one person 
                    knows everything. Which brings me to my last point.</li>
                <li><b>Be open to new approaches.</b> I have found that often I may think that the way that I am doing something is the best way to do it. Sometimes it is best to completely start over and approach the problem from another angle. Again, 
                    be ready to experement.</li>
            </ul>
