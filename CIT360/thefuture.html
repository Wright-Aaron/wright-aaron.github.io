            <h2>What will the future bring?</h2>
            <p>This class has changed my life. The confidence I have gained paired with the new ways of thinking that I have experienced will drive me to look at new challenges much differently.</p>
            <p>One thing that I have already made a goal is to make it a habit to always be trying to learn something new that I can apply to my work in technology. This can be anything from learning 
                about new approaches to networking, to new development architectures. I am very excited to see what continued study will allow me to do with Java.</p>
            <p>I believe this approach to career development will open up new avenues that I could not now comprehend. I work in security right now, but who knows what the future will bring? Maybe in 
                the future I decide to take an opportunity that would not be available without the skills I gained in this class. Maybe the new skill I will seek because I was inspired by this class 
                will be useful down the road. It is impossible to know today but I am sure the learning I will gain will be of some worth.</p>
