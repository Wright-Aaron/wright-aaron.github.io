            <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
            <h3>Sig Sauer</h3>

            <a href="https://www.sigsauer.com/">siqsauer.com</a>
            <p>The Sig Sauer web site has an excellent example of the rule of third
                on their home page. As you can see here in the image the gun which is 
                supposed to be the focal point is right on the subdevision that you
                would use for the rule of thirds.

            <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
            <h3>Reddit</h3>
            <img src="images/reddit.jpg" alt="Reddit home page">
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">reddit.com</a>
            <p>As you can see, this is a great example of visual hierarchy. Reddit
                has made the bigest thing on the screen "The conversation starts here".
                This lets you know as soon as you see the page a general idea of what
                you are getting into. Then the next bigest thing on the screen is the 
                question "what is reddit about?". This is there to entice you to find 
                out more. Next you have the title of the site "Reddit", Incase you 
                forgot where you were. The menu button is also clearly visible. The 
                fine details being the smallest.  
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
            <h3>Corsair</h3>
            <img src="images/corsair.jpg" alt="Corsair home page">
            <a href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/">corsair.com</a>
            <p>Corsair has done a really great job of using white space and clean 
                design on their home page. They have included very little in the way 
                of information on the page itself. There is an image of a CPU cooler 
                with a title and a little slogan. Then they simple invite you to learn 
                more. There is no need for more information here. They also list some 
                other companies they want you to check out (most likely because they 
                have part ownership.) They also don't even include their company name, 
                just their logo. These makes looking at their page very easy to view.
